# PUSH_SWAP_TESTER

This tester script is designed to automate the testing of the push_swap project
It generates random sequences of numbers, runs them through the `push_swap` program, 
and checks the results using the `checker` utility to ensure the sorting algorithm works as expected.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the tester, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Setups

```bash 
1. cd "PATH_TO_YOUR_PUSH_SWAP_REPOSITORY"
```
```bash 
2. git clone https://github.com/AhmedFatir/PUSH_SWAP_TESTER.git
```
```bash 
3. cd PUSH_SWAP_TESTER
```
```bash
4. python3 tester.py "num_numbers" "num_tests" 
```
`example :`
```bash
python3 tester.py 100 50
```
`or just if you need help :`
```bash
python3 tester.py -h
```
